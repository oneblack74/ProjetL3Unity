# Projet L3 Unity

This project was developed during the second semester as part of our coursework. The objective was to create a game using Unity in a group of three, with specific weekly constraints to meet.

## Project Requirements

- **Inventory System**: A modular inventory system in the style of Minecraft, with features like split on right-click. The display and logic are separated into two different scripts.
- **Portals**: Portals that communicate between two scenes (hub world and resources world) with different states (active, cooldown, inactive). There are three distinct scenes (main menu, hub world, and resources world).
- **Player Movement**: Modular scripts for movement, stamina, dash, sprint, and health. Each script is optional and can be used independently (e.g., an AI can use the movement and dash scripts without sprint).
- **Traps**: Traps with different states (active, inactive). At least two different traps (e.g., one that reduces health, one that slows the player).
- **Inventory Persistence**: Ability to save the inventory state between scenes.
- **Chests**: Chests that use the inventory script.
- **Unit Testing**: Unit tests for the inventory system.
- **Crafting**: A crafting system.
- **Script Variables**: Easily adjustable variables for each script for game designers.
